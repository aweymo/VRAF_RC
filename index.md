  content: I was awarded a grant from the Visual Resources Association Foundation
    to partner with the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest Room, to help digitize the
    500,000+ item Richards Collection, a repository of the commercial photography
    studio active in the Puget Sound <span class="s1">from</span> 1921 to 1980. The
    goal of the grant was to help digitize what was regarded as a "dark archive,"
    and focus on better representing Tacoma's historical BIPOC community.

  content: Through a collaborative effort with Northwest Room librarian and project
    sponsor Spencer Bowman, we ultimately found that the collection was not so much
    "dark," as past digitization efforts were scattered, archiving practices were
    inconsistent, and the inherent nature of Richards' practice created a large amount
    of material which provided little contextual information for potential users.

  content: Determining this process involved creating visualizations of the items
    that had been digitized, as well as visualizations of the largest gaps in the
    collection, to pinpoint where to investigate. Using these guides, I was able to
    determine the pockets were generally duplicate photos of an item which had already
    been digitized, or an item which held little contextual value for most patrons.

  content: <p><strong>Considering the hurdles encountered in this project, we were
    still able to make an exceptional impact in our original mission statement to
    surface "significant cultural insights" from the collection that would better
    represent the history of Tacoma's BIPOC community.</strong></p>

    content: Of the 258 items which were selected to be arranged, digitized and described,
      39 represented these communities.

    content: While this number feels minuscule in comparison with the relative size
      of the collection, it represents a 60% increase in BIPOC representation from
      the state of the collection when I began this work in September.

    content: That said, the significance of these photos extend beyond the backgrounds
      of the people occupying the frame and tell a much broader story about the evolving
      social fabric of Tacoma in the twentieth century.

  content: the only picture of an African American laborer I was able to locate in
    the entire collection, portrays a worker securing lumber into a vault where it
    will be treated with arsenic to prevent rot. Even considering the early state
    of workplace safety in 1940, this photo illustrates how African American laborers
    were regarded in midcentury Tacoma, and may also provide some insight into the
    scarcity of representation within the Richards' collection.

  content: If African American workers were consistently given dangerous positions
    that might have resulted in legal repercussions, it's unlikely that the Richards'
    Studio photographers would be using them in the extensive marketing photos which
    they produced for industrial firms during this period.
