  headline: Andrew Weymouth<br>2021-2022 VRAF Grant Project
  content: In September of 2021, I was awarded a grant from the Visual Resources Association
    Foundation to partner with the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest Room, to help
    digitize the 500,000+ item Richards Collection, a repository of the commercial
    photography studio active in the Puget Sound <span class="s1">from</span> 1921
    to 1980. The goal of the grant was to help digitize what was regarded as a "dark
    archive," and focus on better representing Tacoma's historical BIPOC community.
