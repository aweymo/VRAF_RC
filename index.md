  content: I was awarded a grant from the Visual Resources Association Foundation
    to partner with the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest Room, to help digitize the
    500,000+ item Richards Collection, a repository of the commercial photography
    studio active in the Puget Sound <span class="s1">from</span> 1921 to 1980. The
    goal of the grant was to help digitize what was regarded as a "dark archive,"
    and focus on better representing Tacoma's historical BIPOC community.<br><br>Through
    a collaborative effort with Northwest Room librarian and project sponsor Spencer
    Bowman, we ultimately found that the collection was not so much "dark," as past
    digitization efforts were scattered, archiving practices were inconsistent, and
    the inherent nature of Richards' practice created a large amount of material which
    provided little contextual information for potential users.

    duplicate photos of an item which had already been digitized, or an item which
    held little contextual value for most patrons.

    still able to make an exceptional impact in our original mission statement to
    surface "significant cultural insights" from the collection that would better
    represent the history of Tacoma's BIPOC community.</strong></p>

      39 represented these communities.

    content: While this number feels minuscule in comparison with the relative size
      of the collection, it represents a 60% increase in BIPOC representation from
      the state of the collection when I began this work in September.

    content: That said, the significance of these photos extend beyond the backgrounds
      of the people occupying the frame and tell a much broader story about the evolving
      social fabric of Tacoma in the twentieth century.

  content: the only picture of an African American laborer I was able to locate in
    the entire collection, portrays a worker securing lumber into a vault where it
    will be treated with arsenic to prevent rot. Even considering the early state
    of workplace safety in 1940, this photo illustrates how African American laborers
    were regarded in midcentury Tacoma, and may also provide some insight into the
    scarcity of representation within the Richards' collection.

  content: If African American workers were consistently given dangerous positions
    that might have resulted in legal repercussions, it's unlikely that the Richards'
    Studio photographers would be using them in the extensive marketing photos which
    they produced for industrial firms during this period.

    content: Approaching this project, I had assumed that the proximity of Tacoma
      and the neighboring Puyallup Reservation would make some amount of visual documentation
      inevitable. What I found was that the Richards Studio produced many more examples
      of Caucasian people in Native American dress than actual Indigenous communities.
      That said, one example of Native Americans in the Richards Collection felt significant.

    content: In RSO-28, a group which appears to be wearing Veteran of Foreign Wars
      (VFW) garrison hats and casual clothing stand alongside their wives and children
      and a Native American family in traditional dress on Owens Beach, a popular
      Tacoma park overlooking the Puget Sound.<br><br>While no context was included
      with this material and the Native American family is 'othered' through their
      differing dress and placement at the front of the group, the tone of the photo
      reads more like an effort of reconciliation than exploitation, with audience
      expressions ranging from cordial smiles to a respectful solemnity.

    content: Though this interpretation is vulnerable to my own projection, the public
      setting, mixed genders and diverse backgrounds of the group may help add nuance
      to our understanding of reconciliation efforts and the social mindset of fraternal
      organizations like the VFW in midcentury Tacoma.
